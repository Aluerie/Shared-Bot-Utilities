    """Fake Type Class.

    For typing purposes, our `bot.pool` will be "type-ignore"'d-as `PoolTypedWithAny`
    that allows us to properly type the return values via narrowing like mentioned in instructions above
    without hundreds of "pyright: ignore" notices for each TypedDict.

    I could use Protocol to type it all, but `async-stubs` provide a good job in typing most of the stuff
    and we also don't lose doc-string this way.

    * Right now, asyncpg is untyped so this is better than the current status quo
    * If we ever need the regular Pool type we have `bot.database` without any shenanigans.
